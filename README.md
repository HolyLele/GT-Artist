# GT-Artist 

Created by two growtopians from Lithuania.

//////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

All this project is for EDUCATION and ENTERTAINMENT purposes only so we do not seeking any profit from it.
Also, this is for helping Growtopia players to make pixel art in Growtopia game or even to look how any picture 
looks like if it would be made from Growtopia blocks.

Note That GT-Artist is just a pixel art program and does not communicate with Growtopia in any way.
